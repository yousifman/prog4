My final submission fully renders triangles with texture, lighting, and transparency

My submission has the following extra credit:
    - transparent texture support
    - implementation of painter's algorithm (lines 775-800)

Press the 'b' key to toggle between these texture modulation options:
    1: C = Cf\*Ct, A=Af\*At (default)
    2: C = Cf\*(1-Ct) + Ct, A=Af\*At
    3: C = Ct, A=Af\*At
